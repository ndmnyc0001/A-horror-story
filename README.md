# A-horror-story

# This project is a text adventure game. I made it short since I am starting to cde projects at the moment. 
# This is also a based decision game. The whole entire line of code is in a while loop using break towards the end of the code. 
# The break in the end of the code helps terminate the loop. So everytime a person who plays the game wins, it terminates
# And also if the person looses the game it terminates.
# The prints that don't have a quote on them I used them for spacing. I didn't want the sentences to be together.
# I also used a time speed acessor using, import time and import sys. When seeing the letter in the bottom of the import codes,
# It has a number next to them. b is the slowest in speed, c is the fastest in speed and a is between. The purpose of that was to code time.sleep()
# to input the time speed of the numbers I labeled from a, b and, c to get an output of each sentence to either appear faster or slower.
# Majority of my code appear slower I chose b for the speed. I wanted some sort of suspense.
